Seat Them All merges my experience in hospitality with my skills as Developer. 
It's a table management system that allows restaurant operators to manage their floorplans through a drag and drop interface 
Fast, intuitive.

I wrote the app using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Ruby
To build Seat Them All I used Rauby on Rails as framework for the back end, while for the front end I used Bootstrap

Libraries: jQuery, jQueryUI
